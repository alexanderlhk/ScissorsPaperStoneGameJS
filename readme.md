# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game - FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Project

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, built as part of a tutorial from the freeCodeCamp curriculum. It's designed as a practical exercise to solidify core JavaScript concepts.

## Source

This project is based on the following freeCodeCamp lesson:

## Learning Objectives

This project provides hands-on experience with several key JavaScript concepts, including:

*   **DOM Manipulation:** Learn how to use JavaScript to dynamically interact with and modify the structure, style, and content of a web page. This involves selecting elements, changing their attributes, and updating text content.
*   **Event Handling:** Understand how to listen for and respond to user events, such as button clicks. This involves attaching event listeners to elements and executing specific code when those events occur.
*   **Basic Game Logic:** Develop the logical steps necessary to implement a simple game. This includes creating rules, making decisions (like the computer's choice), and determining a winner.
*   **Variables and Data:** Working with variables to store and update the game's state, such as scores and player choices.
*   **Conditional Statements:** Learn to use `if/else` statements to manage the game flow, compare choices, and determine round outcomes.
* **Functions:** Create function to encapsulate and reuse blocks of code.

## How to use this project

* Explore the `script.js` file, to study the code used.
* You can modify this code to experiment and enhance your learning.
* Use this project as a template to start your own projects.

## Run the Project

1. Open the `index.html` on your favorite browser.

By completing this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of these fundamental JavaScript skills and be better prepared for more advanced web development challenges.
